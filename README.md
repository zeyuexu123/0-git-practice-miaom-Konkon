## Why I Think It Interesting

- The Reddit link includes some discussions that cover the definition of software engineering and what the subject is used for. I think that has solved many of my confusions.
- Reddit provides a platform for free discussions, where I could get helpful thoughts and opinions from real people, perhaps some other more experienced students or engineers.
